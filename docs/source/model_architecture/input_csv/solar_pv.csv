Attribute,Unit,Data type,Description
deployment,-,bool,"If set to 'true', the technology will be considered in the energy system model (this does not necessarily mean it will be used). Only relevant for optimisation."
kWp_max,kW,float,Kilowatt Peak: Maximum power output of PV system under standard test conditions (STC).
eta_overall,-,float,Overall conversion efficiency from solar radiation to electricity output at AC side.
co2_intensity,kg CO2/kWh,float,Carbon-dioxide intensity of technology output (annual average value).
lifetime,years,int,Expected lifetime of technology before replacement is required.
capex,CHF/kWp,float,CAPEX cost of technology per unit of capacity.
interest_rate,-,float,Interest rate for computing levelised costs (if required).
potential_integration_factor,-,float,Used for scenario 'pv_integration'. This factor specifies the fraction of additional solar VP potential to be implemented. The additional PV potential is based on suitable roof-space that is not yet covered with PV.
