Attribute,Unit,Data type,Description
deployment,-,bool,"If set to 'true', the technology will be considered in the energy system model (this does not necessarily mean it will be used). Only relevant for optimisation."
kWp_max,kW,float,Kilowatt Peak: Maximum power output of wind power system.
co2_intensity,kg CO2/kWh,float,Carbon-dioxide intensity of technology output (annual average value).
lifetime,years,int,Expected lifetime of technology before replacement is required.
capex_CHFpkWp,CHF/kWp,float,CAPEX cost of technology per unit of capacity.
interest_rate,-,float,Interest rate for computing levelised costs (if required).
potential_integration_factor,-,float,Used for scenario 'wind_power_integration'. This factor specifies the fraction of additional wind power potential to be implemented. The additional wind power potential is based on a a simulation done by Wind-Topo.
wind_power_installed_allocation,-,str,"Decision on whether the installed wind power will be counted towards the local electricity generation or towards the national electricity mix. Options: 'national', 'local'"
v_e_wp_national_recalc,-,bool,"If set to 'true, recalculation of hourly national wind power profile of installed capacity will be carried out; default should be 'false', as this is only required when new wind power plants have been installed."
