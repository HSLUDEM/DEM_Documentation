District Energy Model (DEM)
=========================================================

.. note::

   This project is under active development.

Multi-energy system model for mixed-use districts and communities developped at `HSLU CC TES <https://www.hslu.ch/en/lucerne-school-of-engineering-architecture/about-us/organization/competence-centres-and-research-groups/engineering-and-technology/thermal-energy-storage/>`_ in the framework of the `SWEET EDGE <https://www.sweet-edge.ch/en/work-packages/wp-1>`_ project.


Check out the :doc:`introduction` section for further information.
The District Energy Model has been applied and mentioned in various publications (see :doc:`publications`).

A public platform for municipal energy planning in Switzerland based on the DEM has also been developed and can be accessed here:
