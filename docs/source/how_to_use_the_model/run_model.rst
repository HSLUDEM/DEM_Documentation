Run from source code
--------------------

The model can be run directly from the Python source code found on `GitHub <https://github.com/HSLUDEM/District_Energy_Model>`_. For this purpose, you must install Python along with the respective packages. You can follow these steps:

1. Clone the District_Energy_Model GitHub repository to a local directory:

.. code-block:: shell

    git clone https://github.com/HSLUDEM/District_Energy_Model.git

The :doc:`directory_structure` should be kept as cloned from GitHub.

2. You will find a YAML file in the ``config`` directory named ``dem_conda_environment_X.yml`` or similar. Using this file, create a new Conda environment. Instructions on how to create a Conda environment from file can be found `here <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file>`_. If you're not familier with Conda, take a look at this `user guide <https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/index.html>`_.
