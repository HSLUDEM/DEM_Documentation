Attribute,Description,Standard value,Unit,Data type
``demand_side``,"If set to 'true', the demand side scenario will be implemented. This scenario consists of future climate and demand scenarios specified in the 'demand_side' dict.",False,--,bool
``fossil_heater_retrofit``,"If set to 'true', the fossil heating system retrofit scenario will be implemented. A fraction of the fossil heating capacity will be replaced by heat pumps. The fraction of replacement can be set in the respective technologies (oil_boiler, gas_boiler, wood_boiler).",False,--,bool
``pv_integration``,"If set to 'true', the PV integration scenario will be implemented. A specified share of the additional PV potential will be implemented. The share can be set in the solar_pv technology.",False,--,bool
``wind_integration``,"If set to 'true', the wind power integration scenario will be implemented. A specified share of the additional wind power potential will be implemented. The share can be set in the wind_power technology.",False,--,bool
``thermal_energy_storage``,"If set to 'true', the thermal energy storage (TES) scenario will be implemented. A TES of specified size will be integrated in the energy system and charged/discharged by heat pump. The TES specifications can be set in the 'tes' technology.",False,--,bool
``nuclear_phaseout``,"If set to 'true', a nuclear phaseout will be considered in the simulation, based on the selected year in the 'demand_side' dict.",False,--,bool
