demand_side,"If set to 'true', the demand side scenario will be implemented. This scenario consists of future climate and demand scenarios specified in the 'demand_side' dict.",,--,bool,
fossil_heater_retrofit,"If set to 'true', the fossil heating system retrofit scenario will be implemented. A fraction of the fossil heating capacity will be replaced by heat pumps. The fraction of replacement can be set in the respective technologies (oil_boiler, gas_boiler, wood_boiler).",,--,bool,
pv_integration,"If set to 'true', the PV integration scenario will be implemented. A specified share of the additional PV potential will be implemented. The share can be set in the solar_pv technology.",,--,bool,
wind_integration,"If set to 'true', the wind power integration scenario will be implemented. A specified share of the additional wind power potential will be implemented. The share can be set in the wind_power technology.",,--,bool,
thermal_energy_storage,"If set to 'true', the thermal energy storage (TES) scenario will be implemented. A TES of specified size will be integrated in the energy system and charged/discharged by heat pump. The TES specifications can be set in the 'tes' technology.",,--,bool,
nuclear_phaseout,"If set to 'true', a nuclear phaseout will be considered in the simulation, based on the selected year in the 'demand_side' dict.",,--,bool,
