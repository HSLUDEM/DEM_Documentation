``deployment``,"If set to 'true', the technology will be considered in the energy system model (this does not necessarily mean it will be used). Only relevant for optimisation.",True,--,bool,
``kW_th_max``,Maximum thermal capacity (i.e. heat output).,inf,kW,str,
``co2_intensity``,Carbon-dioxide intensity of technology output (annual average value).,0,kg CO2/kWh,float,
``lifetime``,Expected lifetime of technology before replacement is required.,25,years,int,
``interest_rate``,Interest rate for computing levelised costs (if required).,0.025,--,float,
``capex``,CAPEX cost of technology per unit of capacity (new installations).,6000,CHF/kWp,float,
``capex_one_to_one_replacement``,CAPEX cost of technology per unit of capacity (when device has reached the end of life).,2000,CHF/kWp,float,
``maintenance_cost``,OPEX cost of technology.,10,CHF/kWp/year,float,
``fixed_demand_share``,,False,,bool,
``fixed_demand_share_val``,,0,,float,
``only_allow_existing``,"If True, only existing heat pumps are allowed to continue to operate.",False,--,bool,
``cop_mode``,"Method for estimating the COP timeseries. Options are: “from_file”, “constant”, “from_file_adjusted_to_spf”, “location_based”. “location_based” is an intricate algorithm taking into account building and heat pump properties as well as the local weather (detailed description below). “constant” means that a constant COP is used. “from_file” means means that a timeseries loaded from a given file is used. “from_file_adjusted_to_spf” means that a timeseries loaded form a file is is scaled s.t. a given value for the seasonal performance factor (SPF) is reached",location_based,--,str,
