Carbon Emissions
=================

From version XYZ onwards, carbon emissions are generally
accounted for at the point of import. This means that 
individual conversion technologies, such as 
oil boilers or CHP plants do *not* have individual
carbon emissions. Instead, the import of oil and gas
and other energy carriers is related to emissions
that account for the non-renewable carbon content 
of the energy carrier.

The following inflows are related to carbon emissions:

- oil
- gas
- wood (local)
- wood (import)
- municipal solid waste (msw)
- wet biomass
- electricity import
- district heating import
- waste heat import
- waste heat (low temperature) import

Coal and peat are not present in our energy
system model.

We do not currently account for the 
embodied emissions of the different
energy production and conversion technologies.
