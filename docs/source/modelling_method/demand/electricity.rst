Electricity
========================

Household Demand for Residential Buildings
------------------

The electricity demand from electrical appliances in buildings other than heating and transport is labelled Household Demand. It is modelled
in a bottom-up approach for each individual building.
The annual demand for residential buildings is calculated based on number of inhabitants. The number of inhabitants per building
is estimated based on data on building size taken from the federal register of buildings and dwellings (RBD) (Federal Statistical Office, 2025).
The annual electricity demand per inhabitant is estimated based on the report from the Swiss federal office of energy (SFOE) about typical
electricity demands in Swiss households (Nipkow, 2013). The annual electricity demand per building is then fitted to standard hourly load
profiles (Rinaldi et al., 2022). Different profiles are used for single-family homes and multi-family homes.

Industry and Services
------------------
The electricity for industry and services is computed in a top-down approach as the difference between total demand in the municipality
and Household Demand.
