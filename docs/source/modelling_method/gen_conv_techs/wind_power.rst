Wind Power
=======================================

Wind power represent wind turbines mounted inside the municipality
to generate electricity from wind.
For each Swiss municipality, a wind potential is defined
based on data obtained from (... Zitat source TODOTODO).
The existing wind power generation capacity is given by
data obtained from 

For wind power there  is a distinction more winter-focused
profiles and all-year focused profiles. These correspond to
a different choice of wind power locations. The all-year focused
profiles is based on the turbine locations optimal for reaching
the maximum yearly production. The winter-focused profile is 
geared towards the maximum winter production.
