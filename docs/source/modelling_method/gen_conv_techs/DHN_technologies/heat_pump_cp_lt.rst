Heat Pump Central Plant - From Low Temperature
=======================================

The heat pump central plant represents a large scale heat pump
connected to the district heating network. It supplies directly
useful heat. The heat pump is fed by *low-temperature heat*, which 
is currently just available from the technology *waste heat (low 
temperature)*. It converts low-temperature heat into useful heat.
Its COP is a constant.
