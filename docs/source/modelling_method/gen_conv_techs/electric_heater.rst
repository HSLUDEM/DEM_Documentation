Electric Heater
=======================================

The electric heater is a local energy technology
that converts electric energy into thermal energy
with a given efficiency smaller than 100%. 

For Swiss municipalities, it is usually already
deployed in the standard scenarios because
many buildings use electric heater for domestic 
hot water production and some use it for space heating.

In the optimization, the deployment of new electric heaters
is not allowed.
