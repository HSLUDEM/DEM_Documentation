Solar PV
=======================================

The solar PV technology represents solar PV installations
on rooftops and soon fassades. It is adjusted to the available
roof potential in a given municipality. Currently it uses 
a standard PV profile obtained from a standard panel with an 
inclination of 30 degrees facing south.
