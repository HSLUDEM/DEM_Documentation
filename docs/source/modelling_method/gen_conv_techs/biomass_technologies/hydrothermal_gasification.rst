Hydrothermal Gasification
=======================================

Hydrothermal gasification is another technology
that converts wet biomass into biogas.
Unlike anaerobic digestion, hydrothermal gasification
happens at high temperatures and high pressure.
Therefore its capex is even higher.

The relationship between the in- and outflows is given by

.. math:: \mathtt{v\_gas\_hg} = \mathtt{efficiency} \cdot \mathtt{u\_wet\_bm\_hg} 

The symbols and names of the flows are
