Fossil Heater Retrofit Scenario
=======================================

The fossile heater retrofit scenario is a manual
scenario that represents the replacement of fossil 
(and direct electric) heaters with electric heat pumps.

The percentage of fossil heat generators that are replaced
is given by the parameter replacement_factor in the 
parameters of the technologies oil_boiler, gas_boiler and
electric_heater.

These generation technologies are then replaced by
local heat pumps.
