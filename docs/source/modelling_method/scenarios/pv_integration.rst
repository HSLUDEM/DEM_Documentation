PV Integration Scenario
=======================================

The PV integration scenario represents
the effects of a significant expansion of rooftop 
solar. 
Using the parameters potential_integration_factor
defined in the solar_pv technology, it looks at how 
much potential there is still for PV expansion (i.e.
how much of the solar potential hasn't
been used yet).
It then deploys a given percentage of this, defined by
the potential_integration_factor.
