Wind Integration Scenario
=======================================

The wind integration scenario represents
the effects of a significant expansion of wind power. 
Using the parameters potential_integration_factor
defined in the wind_power technology, it looks at how

It then deploys a given percentage of this, defined by
the potential_integration_factor.
